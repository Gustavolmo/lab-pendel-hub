Pendel Hub is a groundbreaking public transportation app that revolutionizes how people commute. Users can create, share, and join routes, fostering a community-driven approach to transportation. The primary aim of the app is to alleviate the strain on public transportation and provide commuting solutions for areas with limited access to transit services. Additionally, users can post their specific commuting needs, helping identify routes with high demand and aiding government agencies in enhancing public transportation across Sweden.

## Features

- **Create Routes**: Users can easily create their own routes, specifying the starting point, destination and even price. This empowers users to share their daily commuting routes or any other routes they wish to create.

- **Subscribe to Routes**: Users can join routes created by others, becoming passengers on these routes. This feature fosters a collaborative community where people can share rides to common destinations.

- **Post Requested Routes**: Users with specific commuting needs can post requested routes. These routes can help identify high-demand areas and connect commuters with similar needs.

- **Contribute to Public Transportation Planning**: The data collected through the app can be invaluable for government agencies responsible for public transportation. By identifying high-demand areas, the app aids in optimizing existing transportation services and designing new ones.
